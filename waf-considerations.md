- COST 8: How do you plan for data transfer charges?
- COST 9: How do you manage demand, and supply resources?
- COST 10: How do you evaluate new services?

- REL 4: How do you design interactions in a distributed system to prevent failures?
- REL 5: How do you design interactions in a distributed system to mitigate or withstand failures?
- REL 6: How do you monitor workload resources?
- REL 7: How do you design your workload to adapt to changes in demand?
- REL 8: How do you implement change?
- REL 9: How do you back up data?

## [Operational Excellence](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.pillar.operationalExcellence.en.html)

- OPS 1: How do you determine what your priorities are?
- OPS 2: How do you structure your organization to support your OPS 3: OPS 4: How do you design your workload so that you can understand its state?
- OPS 5: How do you reduce defects, ease remediation, and improve flow into production?
- OPS 6: How do you mitigate deployment risks?
- OPS 7: How do you know that you are ready to support a workload?
- OPS 8: How do you understand the health of your workload?
- OPS 9: How do you understand the health of your operations?
